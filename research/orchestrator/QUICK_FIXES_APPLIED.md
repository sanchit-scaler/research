# Quick Fixes Applied - Action Bias Implementation

## Problem Identified
Agents got stuck in a "discussion loop" where they kept talking about what to do instead of actually doing it. Analysis of run log showed:
- Only 2 out of 4 agents used tools at all
- After turn 13, zero tool calls - just endless meta-discussion
- Agents kept saying "I'll create this" but never created anything
- Round-robin turn spacing diluted urgency

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added "Execution Urgency" Section to All 4 Agent Personas
**Location:** `orchestrator/prompts.py` (lines added to each persona)

Added to Alex, Sam, Jordan, and Taylor:
```
## Execution Urgency
When it's your turn and you've identified something to create, BUILD IT IMMEDIATELY 
in this turn using the tools. Don't say "I'll create this" - create it NOW and share 
the result. Don't say "I'll explore that" - explore it NOW using search/list tools. 
The team values action over lengthy discussion. If you're assigned a deliverable, 
execute it in your very next turn, not after more discussion.
```

### 2. Added "Operating Principle" to TOOL_INTEGRATION_WORLD Scenario
**Location:** `orchestrator/prompts.py` (lines 429-434)

Added to the world prompt:
```
### Operating Principle: Action Over Discussion
The team values execution over planning. When someone identifies a deliverable or 
action item, they should CREATE IT IMMEDIATELY in their next turn using the available 
tools. Don't spend multiple turns discussing what to build—just build it and let the 
artifact speak for itself. If you say "I'll create X," then create X in THIS turn, 
not after more discussion rounds.
```

### 3. Updated Reflection Prompt to Emphasize Action
**Location:** `main.py` (lines 156-163)

Changed from:
```python
"Please take a moment to reflect on progress so far. "
"What has been accomplished? What are the next steps? "
"Are there any blockers or concerns?"
```

To:
```python
"Take a moment to reflect: What has been accomplished? What are the next steps? "
"IMPORTANT: If there's something assigned to you or identified as a next deliverable, "
"STOP DISCUSSING and CREATE IT NOW using the tools in this turn. The team values "
"action over planning. Show progress through actual artifacts, not promises."
```

## Expected Impact

1. **Immediate Execution:** Agents will now use tools in the same turn they identify an action
2. **Less Meta-Discussion:** The "I'll create..." → "Great idea!" → "Can't wait!" loop should break
3. **Better Tool Usage Distribution:** All 4 agents should use tools, not just 2
4. **Reflection Prompts as Action Triggers:** Every 8 turns, agents get a nudge to execute, not just reflect

## Testing
Run the tool_integration scenario again and compare:
- Tool calls per agent (should be more balanced)
- Turns between tool usage (should be shorter gaps)
- Actual artifacts created (sheets, workspaces, analysis) vs. promises to create them

## Command to Test
```bash
cd /Users/apple/Github/research/research/orchestrator
python examples.py tool_integration
```
